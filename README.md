# hello-world
I am beginner in GitHub, as implied with this repository name. Yeah, it's the 1st one of mine.
For learning purpose, I will use React. Because I still like class components, I will put some codes that show how to use Context, Render Props and HOC.
However, no need to hurry; I am taking my time to accomplish.
